Continuous Chaos: I advocate for running chaos experiments continuously in production, not just as one-off exercises.

Cross-Team Involvement: I involve multiple teams in chaos engineering practices to improve overall system understanding and resilience.

Learning and Improvement: I ensure that learnings from chaos experiments are documented and fed back into system design and operational practices.

Chaos as Code: I treat chaos experiments as code, versioning them and subjecting them to the same review processes as application code.

Ethical Considerations: I ensure chaos experiments are conducted ethically, with appropriate notifications and safeguards in place.

In a previous role, I introduced chaos engineering practices to improve the resilience of our microservices-based platform. We started by implementing Chaos Monkey to randomly terminate EC2 instances, then gradually introduced more complex failures like network latency and API errors. We ran monthly game days simulating major outages and developed a "chaos engineering runbook" to guide our practices. These efforts led to a 50% reduction in average time to recover from real incidents and uncovered several critical vulnerabilities that we were able to address proactively.

Why this is important: This question assesses your ability to proactively improve system resilience, which is crucial for maintaining Netflix's service reliability. Demonstrating a comprehensive approach to chaos engineering shows your commitment to building robust systems and your ability to manage calculated risks. The focus on continuous testing, gradual implementation, and learning from failures aligns well with Netflix's culture of innovation and its need for a highly resilient global streaming platform.

def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before the function call.")
        func()
        print("After the function call.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

**Output:**

```
Before the function call.
Hello!
After the function call.
```

  - Used to pass a variable number of non-keyworded arguments to a function.
  - The function receives them as a tuple.
  - **Example**:

    ```python
    def my_function(*args):
        for arg in args:
            print(arg)
    ```

- **\*\*kwargs (Keyword Arguments)**:
  - Used to pass a variable number of keyworded arguments to a function.
  - The function receives them as a dictionary.
  - **Example**:

    ```python
    def my_function(**kwargs):
        for key, value in kwargs.items():
            print(f"{key} = {value}")
    ```

**Why It's Important:**

These features provide flexibility:

- **Extensibility**: Functions can handle additional arguments without changing their definition.

  - Creates a new object but inserts references to the items found in the original.
  - Changes to nested mutable objects in the copy affect the original.
  - **Usage**:

    ```python
    import copy
    list1 = [1, [2, 3], 4]
    list2 = copy.copy(list1)
    ```

- **Deep Copy**:
  - Creates a new object and recursively adds copies of nested objects found in the original.
  - Changes to nested objects in the copy do not affect the original.
  - **Usage**:

    ```python
    import copy
    list1 = [1, [2, 3], 4]
    list2 = copy.deepcopy(list1)
    ```

**Why It's Important:**

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

**Example**:

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
```

**Use Cases**:

- **Short Functions**: Ideal for small, simple functions that are used temporarily.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Useful when passing functions as arguments to other functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.

**Example with `map()`**:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squared = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))
```

**Why It's Important:**

Lambda functions showcase:

- **Conciseness**: Ability to write brief and straightforward code.
- **Functional Programming Skills**: Understanding of concepts like first-class functions and higher-order functions.

### **9. How does exception handling work in Python? Explain with an example.**

**Answer:**

Exception handling in Python is managed using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.

- **try**: Contains code that might raise an exception.
- **except**: Catches and handles exceptions.
- **else**: Executes if the `try` block doesn't raise an exception.
- **finally**: Executes regardless of what happens in the `try`, `except`, or `else` blocks.

**Example**:

```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / num
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
else:
    print(f"Result is {result}")
finally:
    print("Execution completed.")
```

**Why It's Important:**

Exception handling ensures:

- **Robustness**: Programs can handle unexpected inputs or errors gracefully.

### **10. What are generators in Python, and how do they differ from normal functions?**

**Answer:**

Generators are special types of iterators that generate values on the fly and can be iterated over one value at a time. They are defined like normal functions but use the `yield` keyword to return values.

**Differences from Normal Functions**:

- **Yield vs. Return**:
  - *Generators*: Use `yield` to return a value and suspend their state between executions.
  - *Normal Functions*: Use `return` to output a value and terminate the function.

- **State Preservation**: Generators maintain their execution state between yields, allowing them to resume where they left off.

- **Memory Efficiency**: Generators are memory-efficient because they produce items one at a time and do not store the entire sequence in memory.

**Example**:

```python
def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1

for number in countdown(5):
    print(number)
```

**Output**:

```
5
4
3
2
1
```

**Why It's Important:**

Understanding generators shows that you can write:

- **Efficient Code**: Handle large datasets without consuming excessive memory.
- **Advanced Constructs**: Utilize Python's advanced features for better performance.

This demonstrates that you're capable of optimizing code for resource management, a valuable skill in development.
